# CMU-Dietrich-Partnerships

Mockup of a potential landing page for [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)'s [Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/), established to provide resources on how groups outside of Carnegie Mellon can connect and form partnerships with students and faculty.

This was created as a term project for Dietrich College's Information Sciences course on Mobile Web Design and Development, course number 67-240, in the Fall 2020 term.
