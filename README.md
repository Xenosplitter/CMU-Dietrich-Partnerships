# CMU-Dietrich-Partnerships

Mockup of a potential landing page for [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)'s [Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/), established to provide resources on how groups outside of Carnegie Mellon can connect and form partnerships with students and faculty.

This was created as a term project for Dietrich College's Information Sciences course on Mobile Web Design and Development, course number 67-240, in the Fall 2020 term.

The current progress of the project leaves us with a template page with a working header and footer. Content can be added to the page in the <main/> element, but is currently occupied by placeholder text. Issues that persist include the implementation of the side nav and the responsiveness of the <main/> contents. Once resolved, pages with real content can be created.

Items that need implementation include:
* Breadcrumbs
* Image carousels
* Side nav
* Improved responsiveness
* Transitions
* Easy structure to add new content in the future, including asides, quotes, and images
* Directory of news articles highlighting partnerships between Dietrich college and external partners
